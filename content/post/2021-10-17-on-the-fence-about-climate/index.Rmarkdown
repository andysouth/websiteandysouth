I've painted my garden fence in Norwich to represent the changing climate recorded in nearby Lowestoft over the past 100 years. The design is relatively simple. There are just four colours, dark blue represents 8 degrees C, light blue 9 degrees C, light red 10 degrees C and dark red 11 degrees C. The design is inspired by, but simpler than, the warming stripes developed by climate scientist Ed Hawkins and used by the BBC to identify their climate coverage during the recent COP 26 climate summit.

Temperatures have been recorded at a Met Office weather station in Lowestoft for more than 100 years. Data are available online, giving the monthly maximum and minimum temperatures. I calculated the midpoint between the extremes per month and then used that that to calculate an average for the year. The number of slats that needed painting on my fence was coincidentally very close to the number of years of temperature data.

I'm a big fan of an open-source data programming language called R. Some R code that someone else had shared online, allowed me to use a computer to experiment with different colour plots. When there was a paint sale at a local DIY superstore I went out & bought 6 different paint colours - three reds for hotter temperatures and three blues for colder temperatures.

Further plotting on the computer, and a consideration for how long it was going to take me to do the physical painting, suggested that using 4 colours might be better than 6. To adapt to this change of plan, I used one of the colours as an undercoat on the whole fence, and haphazardly mixed two to create a shade that better matched my vision (but is not liked by my partner !).

The physical painting process was a joy. It was done in short sessions and our children, 6 & 7, enjoyed doing a bit. Ironically it only got done this year due to an unusually warm & dry September. It was great to chat to passers by - mostly that I didn't know.

To help with interpretation we added some brass dog tags engraved with the year at decadal intervals - placed at a height that they will be best visible to children.

A number of things about how the project evolved really please me. I've made the open-source computer code available online so that others can repeat or modify for different areas. Because it just uses 4 colours, it would be relatively easy (and not horrendously expensive) to get the paint and do something similar yourself. In this case the fact that the temperatures corresponding to the different colours came out as nice round numbers, 8,9,10 & 11 degrees, makes it relatively easy to explain to people on the street. You could choose different shades to represent hot & cold. It could be an instructive project in a school setting, combining science, art, data and computing. Schools often have plenty of fence available. I'm keen to do more climate fence painting should I get the chance !

# chronological, longer, implementation version

Back in 2019 I had the idea to paint my garden fence to represent climate change.

Inspired by the warming stripes of Ed Hawkins.

In 2020 I started designing, bought the paint and started designing.

In 2021 I actually got around to painting it.

It all started from the practical situation that the garden fence of our Norwich house was looking somewhat weather-worn.

I counted the panels to find that there were 88 on the fence, 10 on the gate and 8 posts. This gave me the potential to represent around 100 years. So if I was finishing in the present I could go do about 1920-2020.

I looked at showyourstripes.info the excellent website by the University of Reading and Ed Hawkins. It shows the pattern for the Globe from 1850 based on UK met Office data.

It wasn't obvious how to access the data behind the visualisations - I was going to need that to work out what colour to paint each panel.

...

I really enjoyed the painting, over a number of weeks. I got lots of comments from passers-by mostly that they appreciated the colour. I did'nt reveal the design until close to the end.
